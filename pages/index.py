Layout in Bootstrap is controlled using the grid system. The Bootstrap grid has 
twelve columns.

There are three main layout components in dash-bootstrap-components: Container, 
Row, and Col.

The layout of your app should be built as a series of rows of columns.

We set md=4 indicating that on a 'medium' sized or larger screen each column 
should take up a third of the width. Since we don't specify behaviour on 
smaller size screens Bootstrap will allow the rows to wrap so as not to squash 
the content.

            Subway delays are a near daily occurence in Toronto. This app allows commuters to predict the length of delay and plan their routes for an improved commuting journey. It is also useful for train infrastructure enthusiasts to explore factors behind train delays in one of North American's largest cities.
